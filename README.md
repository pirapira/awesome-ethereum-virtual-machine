# Awesome Ethereum Virtual Machine

A curated list of resources on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is the virtual machine executed on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) network.

## Specification

* [Yellow Paper](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper)
    - A terse specification of EVM and Ethereum blocks

## Tests

* [Consensus test suite](https://github.com/ethereum/tests)
    - EVM implementations can be tested against this test suite

## EVM Implementations

* [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)
    - A popular Ethereum client with its own EVM implementation
* [Parity](https://github.com/paritytech/parity) in Rust
    - Another popular Ethereum client with its own EVM implementation
* [cpp-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum)
    - An Ethereum client that generates the consensus test suite
* [Pyethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum) in Python
    - Another client with probably the best readable EVM implementation
* [Py-EVM](https://github.com/pipermerriam/py-evm) in Python
    - An alternate Python implementation designed to be highly configurable and modular.
* [EthereumJ](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj) in Java
    - A client with its own EVM implementation
* [eth-isabelle](https://github.com/pirapira/eth-isabelle)
    - An EVM implementation for theorem provers
* [Modeling EVM in the K framework](https://github.com/kframework/evm-semantics)
    - An EVM implementation for [K framework](http://www.kframework.org/index.php/Main_Page)
* [hsevm](https://github.com/dapphub/hsevm)
    - An EVM implementation written in Haskell with debugging in mind

## Programming Languages that Compile into EVM

* [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity)
    - The most popular programming language for Ethereum contracts
    - [Awesome Solidity](https://github.com/bkrem/awesome-solidity)
    - The LLL compiler is also in the same repository.
* [Viper](https://github.com/ethereum/viper)
    - A language with overflow-checking, numeric units but without unlimited loops
* [Serpent](https://github.com/ethereum/serpent)
    - A language that looks like Python

## Debuggers

* [REMIX](https://github.com/ethereum/remix)
    - An IDE containing an EVM code debugger
* [debug_traceTransaction method](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Management-APIs#debug_tracetransaction)
    - An instruction-wise trace information provided by go-ethereum

## Code Analyzers

* [evmdis](https://github.com/arachnid/evmdis)
    - A disassembler for EVM code
* [Oyente](https://github.com/melonproject/oyente)
    - An automatic EVM code analyzer based on symbolic execution and [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) SMT solver
* [Dr. Y's Ethereum Contract Analyzer](http://dry.yoichihirai.com/)
    - A symbolic executor for EVM code
* [Compilation Validator/Program Verifier via compilation to F*](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2993611)

## Improvement Proposals

* [Ethereum Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs)
    - A portal for EVM & Ethereum improvements
    - The most immediate changes are listed in the README
* [EVM 1.5](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-615.md)
    - A proposal to tame jumps so that a linear-time scan can determine stack layouts
* [eWASM](https://github.com/ewasm)
    - A proposal to use a [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org/) for Ethereum contract execution
